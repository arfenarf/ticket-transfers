* Load library and raw data.  
* Reorder columns so KGW guess appears early.
* Reorder columns.
* Switch KGW guess from low = big to low = small to make the correlations
appear interesting


```{r}
setwd("~/datacourse/small projects")
spp <- read.csv("Service Provider Patterns - Tidy Data.csv", skip = 1)
spp2 <- spp[,c(1,15,2:14)]
spp2$KGW.Guess <- 14 - spp2$KGW.Guess

```

Plot is a simple correlation plot between KGW Guess and each of the values
that aren't currently NA.  I've taken the log of these guys to try to even out 
the big skew, and added one so the zero values appear.

```{r}
plot(log10(spp2[,2:8] + 1))

```
